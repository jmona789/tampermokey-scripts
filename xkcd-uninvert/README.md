A script that lets you uninvert and re-invert the colors on xkcd comics.  To be used with dark themes that add a `filter: invert(100%) hue-rotate(180deg);`  Which works well for xkcd since most comics are black and white, and with `hue-rotate(180deg)` it even works for most of the xkcds that are more colorful, but not for all of them, thus, this script adds a button lets you swicth between univerted and uninverted.
